# pylywsdxx

This is a Python3 library to allow interrogation of Xiaomi Mijia LYWSD* sensors via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).

**Note**: This is an unofficial project, and is in no way supported or endorsed by Xiaomi.

## Requirements

This module requires [`bluepy3`](https://pypi.org/project/bluepy3/) which should be installed automagically when using the installation instructions below.

Development of this package is done in Python 3.11. The package is considered forwards compatible at least upto Python 3.12 and probably also beyond. Backwards compatibility is not guaranteed; if it works on Python 3.9 or before consider yourself lucky. [Python versions that are end-of-life](https://devguide.python.org/versions/) are not supported.

The package has been extensively tested on a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ (aarch64) with Debian GNU Linux 12 /w Python 3.11.*.


## Installation

```
pip install pylywsdxx
```

## Usage

```
import pylywsdxx as pyly

mac = "A4:C1:38:0D:EA:D0"

device2 = pyly.Lywsd02(mac)
data2 = device2.data
print(f"Temperature: {data2.temperature}??C")

device3 = pyly.Lywsd03(mac)
data3 = device3.data
print(f"Temperature: {data3.temperature}??C")
```

Please note that this module has completely and intentionally broken backwards compatibility with previous
and existing versions of `lywsd02` and `lywsd03mmc` and with v1.* versions of itself.
